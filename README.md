# Kafka Example

## Introduction
This is a simple Flask application that integrates the use of Kafka.
This is purely a personal project. 

I will be working on this incrementally, working on new Kafka features
as well as refactoring the project structure to ensure that everything 
readable and understandable by me or anyone else who wants to view this project.

Thanks!
